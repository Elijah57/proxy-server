# A Basic Proxy Server

 This is a basic proxy server to handle request
A proxy server is an intermediary that sits between a web browser or client and the internet.

I.e Rather than the client making request directly to the internet, the proxy makes to request on behalf of the client and send the response back to the client.

Analogy:

## Proxy:

- The king of Ingland is feeling very cocky and wants to colonize a nation. Since it has colonize other neigbouring nations around it, There is no need to make arrangements from Ingland to conquer that nation, it can achieve that with the already colonized neigbouring countries and get reports on what is currently going on.

(new scene)
- The Army of the already-colonized nation, will marched to the soon-to-be-colonized nation. On reaching the gates, would read a scroll as follows 
>"eh eh Ehm, (clears throat) By the Order of the Peaky Blinders we want to take over this nation, as his grace finds this place a favourable breeding ground for his dogs, you shall be given the benefit of having your heads above your shoulder, if you comply..... That will be all for now, 

(The captain of the Army, then says) Men!!!, Kill them all!!! ( the horse marching on...(chukwu di, chukwu di x5))"
